Overflow Flag
-------------

The rules for turning on the overflow flag in binary/integer math are two:

1. If the sum of two numbers with the sign bits off yields a result number
   with the sign bit on, the "overflow" flag is turned on.

   0100 + 0100 = 1000 (overflow flag is turned on)

2. If the sum of two numbers with the sign bits on yields a result number
   with the sign bit off, the "overflow" flag is turned on.

   1000 + 1000 = 0000 (overflow flag is turned on)

Otherwise, the overflow flag is turned off.
 * 0100 + 0001 = 0101 (overflow flag is turned off)
 * 0110 + 1001 = 1111 (overflow flag is turned off)
 * 1000 + 0001 = 1001 (overflow flag is turned off)
 * 1100 + 1100 = 1000 (overflow flag is turned off)

Note that you only need to look at the sign bits (leftmost) of the three
numbers to decide if the overflow flag is turned on or off.
